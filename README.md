1. **<font color="red">Data Set Used</font>** Breast Cancer Dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29 
                 Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the      image.n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
                 Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
2. **<font color="red">Missing Values</font>**
            It is not unusual for an object to be missing one or more attribute values. In some cases, the information was not collected; while in other cases, some attributes are inapplicable to the data instances. This section presents examples on the different approaches for handling missing values. 
            Observe that only the 'Bare Nuclei' column contains missing values. In the following example, the missing values in the 'Bare Nuclei' column are replaced by the median value of that column. The values before and after replacement are shown for a subset of the data points.
            Instead of replacing the missing values, another common approach is to discard the data points that contain missing values. This can be easily accomplished by applying the dropna() function to the data frame.

            
3. **<font color="red">Outliers</font>**
          Outliers are data instances with characteristics that are considerably different from the rest of the dataset. In the example code below, we will draw a boxplot to identify the columns in the table that contain outliers. Note that the values in all columns (except for 'Bare Nuclei') are originally stored as 'int64' whereas the values in the 'Bare Nuclei' column are stored as string objects (since the column initially contains strings such as '?' for representing missing values). Thus, we must convert the column into numeric values first before creating the boxplot. Otherwise, the column will not be displayed when drawing the boxplot.

4. **<font color="red">Duplicate Data</font>**
          Some datasets, especially those obtained by merging multiple data sources, may contain duplicates or near duplicate instances. The term deduplication is often used to refer to the process of dealing with duplicate data issues. 
          
5. **<font color="red">Aggregration</font>**
      Data aggregation is a preprocessing task where the values of two or more objects are combined into a single object. The motivation for aggregation includes (1) reducing the size of data to be processed, (2) changing the granularity of analysis (from fine-scale to coarser-scale), and (3) improving the stability of the data.

6. **<font color="red">Sampling</font>**
  Sampling is an approach commonly used to facilitate (1) data reduction for exploratory data analysis and scaling up algorithms to big data applications and (2) quantifying uncertainties due to varying data distributions.

7. **<font color="red">Discretization</font>**
      Discretization is a data preprocessing step that is often used to transform a continuous-valued attribute to a categorical attribute. The example below illustrates two simple but widely-used unsupervised discretization methods (equal width and equal depth) applied to the 'Clump Thickness' attribute of the breast cancer dataset.
